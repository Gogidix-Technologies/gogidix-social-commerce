## Notes

1. **Domain Model**: The `domain-model` folder contains shared entities but is not configured as a Maven module, which is causing compilation issues across services.

2. **Service Dependencies**: Many services depend on `social-commerce-shared` and `domain-model` for common functionality.

3. **Configuration Services**: `social-commerce-production` and `social-commerce-staging` appear to be environment-specific configuration services.

4. **Complete Stack**: The domain includes a full microservices architecture with proper separation of concerns, API gateway, and multiple frontend applications.
