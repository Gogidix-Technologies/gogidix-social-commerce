@Service
public class MultiCurrencyInvoiceService {
    
    @Autowired
    private CurrencyExchangeService currencyService;
    
    @Autowired

        // Build invoice with multi-currency support
        Invoice invoice = Invoice.builder()
            .number(generateInvoiceNumber())
            .date(LocalDate.now())
            .dueDate(calculateDueDate(request.getPaymentTerms()))
            .currency(request.getCurrency())
            .customer(buildCustomerInfo(request.getCustomerId()))
            .build();
        
        // Process line items with currency conversion
        BigDecimal subtotal = BigDecimal.ZERO;
        for (InvoiceLineItemRequest itemRequest : request.getItems()) {
            InvoiceLineItem item = processLineItem(itemRequest, request.getCurrency(), rates);
            invoice.addLineItem(item);
            subtotal = subtotal.add(item.getTotal());
        }
        
        // Calculate taxes based on region and currency
        TaxCalculation taxCalc = taxService.calculateTax(
            subtotal, 
            request.getCurrency(),
            request.getBillingAddress().getCountry()
        );
        
        invoice.setSubtotal(subtotal);
        invoice.setTaxAmount(taxCalc.getTotalTax());
        invoice.setTotal(subtotal.add(taxCalc.getTotalTax()));
        
        // Apply currency-specific formatting
        formatInvoiceAmounts(invoice, request.getCurrency());
        
        return invoiceRepository.save(invoice);
    }
    
    private InvoiceLineItem processLineItem(InvoiceLineItemRequest request, 
                                          String targetCurrency, 
                                          ExchangeRates rates) {
        // Convert price if needed
        BigDecimal unitPrice = request.getUnitPrice();
        if (!request.getCurrency().equals(targetCurrency)) {
            unitPrice = currencyService.convert(
                unitPrice, 
                request.getCurrency(), 
                targetCurrency,

### Automated Tax Calculation

```java
// Example: Multi-jurisdiction tax calculation
@Service
public class TaxCalculationService {
    
    @Autowired
    private TaxRateRepository taxRateRepository;
    
    public TaxCalculation calculateTax(BigDecimal amount, String currency, String country) {
        TaxCalculation calculation = new TaxCalculation();
        
        // Get applicable tax rates for country
        List<TaxRate> applicableRates = taxRateRepository.findByCountryAndCurrency(country, currency);
        
        for (TaxRate rate : applicableRates) {
            TaxComponent component = new TaxComponent();
            component.setType(rate.getTaxType());
            component.setRate(rate.getRate());
            component.setAmount(amount.multiply(rate.getRate()));
            
            calculation.addComponent(component);
        }
        
        // Handle special cases
        if (isEUCountry(country) && isB2BTransaction()) {
            // Apply reverse charge mechanism
            calculation = applyReverseCharge(calculation);
        }
        
        if (isDigitalService() && isEUCountry(country)) {
            // Apply digital services VAT rules
            calculation = applyDigitalServicesVAT(calculation, country);
        }
        
        return calculation;
    }
    
    private TaxCalculation applyReverseCharge(TaxCalculation calculation) {
        // Reverse charge: customer pays VAT instead of supplier
        calculation.setReverseCharge(true);
        calculation.getComponents().forEach(component -> {
            if (component.getType() == TaxType.VAT) {
                component.setReverseCharge(true);
                component.setAmount(BigDecimal.ZERO);
            }
        });
        return calculation;
    }
}
```

    public byte[] generatePDFInvoice(Invoice invoice) {
        try (ByteArrayOutputStream output = new ByteArrayOutputStream()) {
            PDDocument document = new PDDocument();
            
            // Load company branding
            PDPageContentStream contentStream = setupPage(document);
            
            // Add company logo and header
            addCompanyHeader(contentStream, invoice);
            
            // Add customer information
            addCustomerInformation(contentStream, invoice);
            
            // Add invoice details
            addInvoiceDetails(contentStream, invoice);
            
            // Add line items table
            addLineItemsTable(contentStream, invoice);
            
            // Add totals section
            addTotalsSection(contentStream, invoice);
            
            // Add payment terms and footer
            addPaymentTermsAndFooter(contentStream, invoice);
            
            contentStream.close();
            document.save(output);
            document.close();
            
            return output.toByteArray();
            
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new InvoiceGenerationException("Failed to generate PDF invoice", e);
        }
    }
    
    private void addLineItemsTable(PDPageContentStream contentStream, Invoice invoice) 
            throws IOException {
        
        float yPosition = 500f;
        float tableWidth = 500f;
        float rowHeight = 20f;
        
        // Table headers
        String[] headers = {"Description", "Qty", "Unit Price", "Total"};
        drawTableHeaders(contentStream, headers, yPosition, tableWidth);
        
        yPosition -= rowHeight;
        
        // Line items
        for (InvoiceLineItem item : invoice.getLineItems()) {
            String[] rowData = {
                item.getDescription(),
                String.valueOf(item.getQuantity()),
                formatCurrency(item.getUnitPrice(), invoice.getCurrency()),
                formatCurrency(item.getTotal(), invoice.getCurrency())
            };
            
            drawTableRow(contentStream, rowData, yPosition, tableWidth);
            yPosition -= rowHeight;
        }
        
        // Draw table borders
        drawTableBorders(contentStream, yPosition + rowHeight, tableWidth, 
                        invoice.getLineItems().size() + 1);
    }
    
    private String formatCurrency(BigDecimal amount, String currency) {
        NumberFormat formatter = NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
        formatter.setCurrency(Currency.getInstance(currency));
        return formatter.format(amount);
    }
}
```
