## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION TEMPLATE FOR FUTURE INTEGRATIONS

### **Proven Pattern for Cross-Domain Services**:

#### **1. Core Service Architecture**:
```
UnifiedServiceClient
├── Core functionality (shared logic)
├── Regional/domain routing
└── HTTP communication layer

DomainIntegrationService (per domain)
├── Domain-specific methods
├── Business logic adaptation
└── Metadata enrichment

ServiceMetricsController
├── Unified analytics API
├── Domain-specific endpoints
└── Cross-domain dashboard
```

#### **2. Traceability Implementation**:
- **Service ID Prefixing**: `WAREHOUSE_NOTIFICATION_*`, `COURIER_FILE_*`
- **Metadata Tagging**: Domain-specific context information
- **Entity Type Classification**: Service-level segregation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction attribution

#### **3. Quality Assurance**:
- **Zero Code Duplication**: Delegation pattern mandatory
- **No Regressions**: Preserve all existing functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full integration test coverage
- **Enterprise Documentation**: Complete implementation guides
