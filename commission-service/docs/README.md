# Commission Service Documentation

## Overview

The Commission Service is a critical financial component within the Social E-commerce Ecosystem that manages the calculation, tracking, and distribution of commissions for vendor transactions. This service implements sophisticated commission calculation algorithms, supports multi-tier rate structures, and provides comprehensive reporting capabilities for transparent financial operations.

## Business Context

In the social commerce ecosystem, commission management is fundamental to the platform's revenue model and vendor relationships:

- **Transaction-Based Revenue**: Calculate commissions on every completed transaction
- **Flexible Rate Structures**: Support vendor-specific, category-based, and promotional commission rates
- **Financial Transparency**: Provide clear commission breakdowns and reporting for vendors
- **Compliance Requirements**: Maintain audit trails and compliance with financial regulations

    "expiryDate": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }'
```

### Commission Reporting

```java
// Example: Commission calculation service
@Service
public class CommissionCalculationService {
    
    public CommissionResult calculateCommission(CommissionRequest request) {
        // Get applicable commission rate
        CommissionRate rate = rateService.getApplicableRate(
            request.getVendorId(), 
            request.getCategoryId(), 
            request.getTransactionDate()
        );
        
        // Calculate base commission
        BigDecimal baseCommission = request.getAmount()
            .multiply(rate.getRate())
            .setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
        
        // Apply performance bonuses
        BigDecimal performanceBonus = performanceService
            .calculatePerformanceBonus(request.getVendorId(), baseCommission);
        
        // Apply promotions
        BigDecimal promotionalAdjustment = promotionService
            .calculatePromotionalAdjustment(request, baseCommission);
        
        BigDecimal finalCommission = baseCommission
            .add(performanceBonus)
            .add(promotionalAdjustment);
        
        return CommissionResult.builder()
            .baseCommission(baseCommission)
            .performanceBonus(performanceBonus)
            .promotionalAdjustment(promotionalAdjustment)
            .finalCommission(finalCommission)
            .rate(rate)
            .calculatedAt(Instant.now())
            .build();
    }
}
```

### Rate Hierarchy Management

```java
// Example: Commission rate hierarchy
@Entity
public class CommissionRate {
    
    public enum RateType {
        GLOBAL_DEFAULT,
        CATEGORY_SPECIFIC,
        VENDOR_SPECIFIC,
        PROMOTIONAL,
        PERFORMANCE_TIER
    }
    
    public CommissionRate getEffectiveRate(String vendorId, String categoryId, LocalDateTime date) {
        // Priority order: Promotional > Vendor-specific > Category-specific > Global default
        return rateRepository.findEffectiveRate(vendorId, categoryId, date)
            .stream()
            .sorted(Comparator.comparing(CommissionRate::getPriority).reversed())
            .findFirst()
            .orElse(getGlobalDefaultRate());
    }
}
```

### Real-Time Commission Processing

```java
// Example: Event-driven commission processing
@Component
public class CommissionEventProcessor {
    
    @EventListener
    public void handleOrderCompletedEvent(OrderCompletedEvent event) {
        try {
            CommissionRequest request = CommissionRequest.builder()
                .transactionId(event.getOrderId())
                .vendorId(event.getVendorId())
                .categoryId(event.getCategoryId())
                .amount(event.getTotalAmount())
                .currency(event.getCurrency())
                .transactionDate(event.getCompletedAt())
                .build();
            
            CommissionResult result = commissionCalculationService
                .calculateCommission(request);
            
            commissionTransactionService
                .createCommissionTransaction(result);
            
            notificationService
                .notifyVendorCommissionEarned(event.getVendorId(), result);
                
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            log.error("Failed to process commission for order: {}", event.getOrderId(), ex);
            commissionEventService.scheduleRetry(event);
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Financial Accuracy

2. **Rounding Standards**: Apply consistent rounding rules across all calculations
3. **Currency Handling**: Implement proper currency conversion and precision management
4. **Audit Trails**: Maintain complete audit logs for all commission calculations
5. **Data Validation**: Validate all financial data inputs for accuracy and compliance

### Performance Optimization
1. **Rate Caching**: Cache commission rates in Redis for fast lookup
2. **Batch Processing**: Process commission calculations in optimized batches
3. **Database Optimization**: Use appropriate indexes for commission queries
4. **Async Processing**: Use asynchronous processing for non-critical commission operations
5. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections for high-throughput operations

### Security
1. **Financial Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive commission and rate data
2. **Access Control**: Implement strict role-based access for commission management

2. **Data Consistency**: Ensure data consistency across commission-related services
3. **Event Processing**: Handle commission events reliably with retry mechanisms
4. **API Versioning**: Maintain backward compatibility for commission APIs
5. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for financial operations

### Monitoring
1. **Financial Metrics**: Monitor commission calculation accuracy and performance
2. **Rate Monitoring**: Track commission rate changes and their impacts
3. **Transaction Monitoring**: Monitor commission transaction volumes and patterns
4. **Error Tracking**: Track and alert on commission calculation errors
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor service performance and response times

## Commission Rate Hierarchy

### Rate Priority System
1. **Promotional Rates** (Highest Priority) - Limited-time promotional commission rates
2. **Performance-Based Rates** - Rates based on vendor performance metrics
3. **Vendor-Specific Rates** - Negotiated rates for individual vendors
4. **Category-Specific Rates** - Rates specific to product categories
5. **Global Default Rates** (Lowest Priority) - Platform-wide default commission rates

### Rate Configuration Examples

```yaml
# Commission rate examples
commission-rates:
  global-default: 0.05  # 5%
  categories:
    FASHION: 0.06       # 6%
    ELECTRONICS: 0.04   # 4%
    BOOKS: 0.08         # 8%
  vendor-tiers:
    PREMIUM: 0.03       # 3%
    STANDARD: 0.05      # 5%
    STARTER: 0.07       # 7%
  promotional:
    NEW_VENDOR_PROMO: 0.02  # 2% for first 3 months
