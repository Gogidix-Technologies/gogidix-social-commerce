## Environment Standardization Summary

### Java Backend Services (22 total)
- ✅ **Compliant**: 20 services (90%)
- ❌ **Non-Compliant**: 2 services (9%)

### Frontend Services (5 total)
- ✅ **Compliant**: 5 services (100%)
- ❌ **Non-Compliant**: 0 services (0%)

## Critical Environment Issues

### Java Services Issues:
1. Services missing Spring Boot 3.1.5 standardization
2. Missing Maven wrapper in some services
3. Lombok not consistently configured
4. Missing application configuration files

### Frontend Services Issues:
1. Node.js version not specified in most services
2. Some services using older React versions
3. Missing lock files for dependency management

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Java Environment**:
   - Update all services to Spring Boot 3.1.5
   - Add Spring Cloud 2022.0.4 where needed
   - Ensure Java 17 in all pom.xml files

2. **Standardize Frontend Environment**:
   - Add .nvmrc files with Node.js 20.x
   - Upgrade all services to React 18.x
   - Ensure TypeScript 5.x where applicable

3. **Container Standardization**:
   - Use eclipse-temurin:17-jre for Java services
   - Use node:20-alpine for frontend services

---

**Task 4 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

Environment standardization has been validated. Most services require updates to meet the specified standards.
